## Abstract

Often times when people think of public health, the home you live in
does not come to mind. But many people all over the country and in
Minnesota have severe housing problems, a home with severe housing
problems are households with at least one of four housing problems:
overcrowding, high housing costs, lack of kitchen facilities, or lack of
plumbing facilities. So, the question I have is, do severe housing
problems have an effect on your overall health and your life expectancy?
I will be using data from the Minnesota Health Outcomes data set, from
countyhealthrankings.org. My exploratory data analysis will compare the
variables of percentage of Severe Housing problems with Life expectancy
among counties in Minnesota. I believe the results of this analysis will
help medical workers and public health workers better focus on simple
things like where people eat, sleep, play to help diagnose and treat
peopleâ€™s health issues and keep people as healthy as possible.
